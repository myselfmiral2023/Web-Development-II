someone wants to rent a car from october 12th - october 14th

come driven.com

register -> login - have an account

they enter their desired dates

RETURNED FROM SEARCH - any cars that have uninterrupted availability from customer booking request START DATE
until customer booking request END DATE
-> this will work by querying the database for all 'Vehicle Bookings' excluding all those bookings where the ENDDATE is between 
the searched start date and and the searched end date (so where endate > searchStart AND enddate < searchEnd) THEN join the vehicles
referenced by vehicle id in these rows returned from vehicle bookings, THEN return the types referenced by typeid on these rows returned
from vehicles table : RESULT DISPLAYED TO CLIENT: these are the types of cars available for your entered dates

array of car objects - DO WE need the vehicle type(model) table in this logic?

if we want to enable a car first search - a customer NEEDS a minivan, so we provide them the earliest next minivan avialbility - starting at the soonest return time of a minievan vehicle


admin wants to add a new vehicle to the roster

admin has an individual honda accord

-> a new type (model) of car is added to the type table
 types in our type table, for which we have no concrete vehicles? I dont think its an issue
 this is important because the field in the vehicles table for model (type) is NOT NULL, so adding a new vehicle which a new type of car for the store, will require an update to the type table FIRST

-> a new individual vehicle is added to the vehicle table
